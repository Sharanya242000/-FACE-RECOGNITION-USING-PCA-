# -FACE-RECOGNITION-USING-PCA-
 The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most effective image recognition and compression algorithms ever developed [1]. PCA reduces the huge dimensionality of the data space (observed variables) to the smaller intrinsic dimensionality of feature space (independent variables), which is required to economically characterize the data.   The covariance matrix of a training image set yields these eigenvectors [2],[3]. The weights are calculated after determining a set of the most relevant eigenfaces. A support vector classifier obtains project input images to principal components and classification. The amount of variance retained is misgiven by the number of principal components we choose. The dataset is obtained from the Github repository Code Heroku and implemented using python3.
